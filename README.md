# Flowace-task-1 - Seating Arrangement
The complete seating arrangement is divided into 3 sections i.e S1, S2 and S3.
We have to design a seating arrangement for families. Each family comprises of exactly "4" members
in it.You need to create a function which accepts 2 parameters: 1) No. of rows ("r" -> Integer) 2) Blocked
seats (For example = [ a1, a3, b2, c1, c6 ,...])
While making the arrangement, you have to take this into consideration that all 4 members need to
seat together in a single row.
You can exactly opt for 2 seats at a time from S1, S3.
Such cases like ABCD, EFGH, GHJK ACDF, etc are not possible.
Expected :
You need to find the maximum number of families that can get accommodated in the theater.
